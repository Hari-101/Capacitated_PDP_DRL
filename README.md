## Dependencies

* Python>=3.6
* NumPy
* SciPy
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)>=1.1
* tqdm
* [tensorboard_logger](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger)
* Matplotlib (optional, only for plotting)

## Quick start

For training PDP instances with 20 nodes and using rollout as REINFORCE baseline:
```bash
python run.py --graph_size 20 --baseline rollout --run_name 'PDP20_rollout'
```

## Usage

### Generating data

Training data is generated on the fly. To generate validation and test data with uniform distribution (same as used in the paper) for pdp, and sigma is meaningful when 'is_gaussian' is True.
```bash
python generate_data.py --name validation --seed 1234 --is_gaussian 0 --sigma 1.0
python generate_data.py --name test --seed 6666 --is_gaussian 0 --sigma 1.0
```
To generate test data with gaussian distribution with sigma=1.0 (same as used in the paper) for pdp:
```bash
python generate_data.py --name test --seed 6666 --is_gaussian 1 --sigma 1.0
```

### Training

For training PDP instances with 20 nodes and using rollout as REINFORCE baseline and using the generated validation set:
```bash
python run.py --graph_size 20 --baseline rollout --run_name 'pdp20_rollout' --val_dataset data/pdp/pdp20_validation_seed1234.pkl
```

#### Multiple GPUs
By default, training will happen *on all available GPUs*. To disable CUDA at all, add the flag `--no_cuda`. 
Set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to only use specific GPUs:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3 python run.py 
```
Note that using multiple GPUs has limited efficiency for small problem sizes (up to 50 nodes).

#### Warm start

The `--load_path` option can be used to load an earlier run, in which case also the optimizer state will be loaded:
```bash
python run.py --graph_size 20 --load_path 'outputs/pdp_20/pdp20_rollout_{datetime}/epoch-0.pt'
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate a model, you can add the `--eval-only` flag to `run.py`, or use `eval.py`, which will additionally measure timing and save the results:
```bash
python eval.py data/pdp/pdp20_test_seed6666.pkl --model 'outputs/pdp_20/pdp20_rollout_{datetime}/epoch-{epoch_number}.pt' --decode_strategy greedy
```
If the epoch is not specified, by default the last one in the folder will be used.

#### Sampling
To report the best of 1280 sampled solutions, use
```bash
python eval.py data/pdp/pdp20_test_seed6666.pkl --model 'outputs/pdp_20/pdp20_rollout_{datetime}/epoch-{epoch_number}.pt' --decode_strategy sample --width 1280 --eval_batch_size 1
```

### Other options and help
```bash
python run.py -h
python eval.py -h
```
